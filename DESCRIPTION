Description: Algorithms for multivariate outlier detection when missing values
    occur. Algorithms are based on Mahalanobis distance or data depth.
    Imputation is based on the multivariate normal model or uses nearest
    neighbour donors. The algorithms take sample designs, in particular
    weighting, into account. The methods are described in Bill and Hulliger
    (2016) <doi:10.17713/ajs.v45i1.86>.
