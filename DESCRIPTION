Description: Algorithms for multivariate outlier detection when missing values occur.
    Algorithms are based on Mahalanobis distance or data depth. Imputation is based
    on the multivariate normal model or uses nearest neighbour donors. The algorithms 
    take sample designs, in particular weighting, into account.
